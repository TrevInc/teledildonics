# teledildonics
Illumittani emote pack
Custom emote pack for Pidgin and Adium that includes the GSF's SA emotes, some emotes from Berachs old EVE Emote pack, various Twitch emotes, and a few custom additions. Many of these emotes are not work-safe and may be not suitable for minors.

To install in Pidgin:

1. Locate your Pidgin user data folder (usually %appdata%/.purple/)
2. Extract teledildonics folder to smileys folder (correct directory structure should resemble /%appdata%/.purple/smileys/teledildonics/4head.png)
3. Select from Tools > Preferences > Themes > Smileys in Pidgin

Restarting Pidgin is not required. If you install a new version of the pack after Pidgin has already loaded it, simply select another emote pack from the Smileys menu's dropdown then switch back to teledildonics. Changes will take effect immediately and the new version of the pack will be used for any new lines in conversations.

To load your emote pack into Adium, add .AdiumEmoticonSet to the end of the name of the folder containing the emote images, then put the file into the /Library/Application Support/Adium 2.0/Emoticons/ folder. Restart Adium and if it is done correctly Adium will add the emoticon pack to the list.

Adium emote library created with https://github.com/TrevInc/pidgin-to-adium-emote-pack-converter and installation instructions have been shamelessly stolen from his readme. If you run into any issues installing this pack in Adium, refer to someone else for help because I don't have the right environment for testing it.
