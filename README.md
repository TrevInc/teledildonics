# teledildonics
Illumittani emote pack
Custom emote pack for Pidgin that includes the GSF's SA emotes, some emotes from Berachs old EVE Emote pack, various Twitch emotes, and a few custom additions. Many of these emotes are not work-safe and may be not suitable for minors. Features dank memes.

To install in Pidgin:

1. Locate your Pidgin user data folder (usually %appdata%/.purple/)
2. Extract teledildonics folder to smileys folder (correct directory structure should resemble /%appdata%/.purple/smileys/teledildonics/4head.png)
3. Select from Tools > Preferences > Themes > Smileys in Pidgin

Restarting Pidgin is not required. If you install a new version of the pack after Pidgin has already loaded it, simply select another emote pack from the Smileys menu's dropdown then switch back to teledildonics. Changes will take effect immediately and the new version of the pack will be used for any new lines in conversations.
